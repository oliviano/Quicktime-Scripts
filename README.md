Quicktime-Scripts

A Collection of Quicktime Player Scripts

Scripts:
--------

* High Quality
A droplet script to switch the "high quality" property to enabled. 
This is very practical in the days of SD, when by default, quicktime movies didn't have the High Quality switch enabled.  
	
* Size Me Up
A droplet script & normal script to alter dimension of the track to a hard coded preset. Will allow to batch a folder.
